# Pet Artworks Platform

**Pet Artworks Platform** is a creative collaboration web application that bridges the **ArtGallery** and **PawPals** projects.

Built with ASP.NET Core, the platform provides comprehensive management tools for different domains.
**ArtGallery** allows guests to explore artworks, artists, and exhibitions, while registered users can manage gallery content.
**PawPals** enables admins to oversee members and their pets, facilitating connections and CRUD operations. Both applications utilize Entity Framework and MVC architecture for a seamless and user-friendly experience.

The core connection between ArtGallery and PawPals is **pet-related artwork**. Users can explore artworks featuring pets and access detailed pet information associated with each piece. Registered users can also add or remove artworks directly from a pet's detail page, enhancing the interactive experience between art and pet communities.
